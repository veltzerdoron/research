Hebrew word embedding folder:
* improve model (wait for better w2v model to arrive or maybe bert?!)
* use doc2vec so as not to rely on BOW?
* use language model or bert to limit the search space of possible n tokens (brute force is NPC)

Done:
* implemented GMatrix methods
* wrote 2 word and n word BF search
* found all sub group words (from given set) with constant known sum (perfect sum)
