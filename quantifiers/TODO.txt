STS:
* do generalization and length tests for STS
* reread V(Keenan), STS & V(Chemla) and Quantifier acquisition

Urgent:
* AE
* do generalization tests on my models
* read CNN biological plausibility papers
* analysis of model weight values after training (Conv + Dense)
    * understand how CNN learns unnatural quantifiers

Done:
* CNN, DNN version of NN

*understand STS code + analysis

* confusion matrix metrics
   Conv1D usage is not very efficient on GPU moved to CPU
* fix CuDNN dll library versions to make the conv work with GPU:

* compare natural quantifier to general quantifiers learning
* added test for random scenes
* wrote code for teacher student
    This is a problematic method, leave repeat at 1 to neutralize
* rewrote my models pdf
* wrote abstract for Rony and get back in contact


Future ideas:
*** check if the classifier can learn non conservative quantifiers
*** run this on random world/ general quantifier world/natural quantifier world to tease apart the effects of the world and that of the "computation cognitive bias".
