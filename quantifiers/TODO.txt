STS:
V- understand STS code + analysis
* do generalization and length tests for STS
* reread Keenan, STS & Chemla and Quantifier acquisition

Urgent:

V- CNN, DNN version of NN
V- confusion matrix metrics
   Conv1D usage is not very efficient on GPU moved to CPU
V- fix CuDNN dll library versions to make the conv work with GPU:
    https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-gpu-in-ubuntu-20-04-4ee3ca4cb75d
V- compare natural quantifier to general quantifiers learning
V- added test for random scenes
V- wrote code for teacher student
    This is a problematic method, leave repeat at 1 to neutralize
V- read CNN biological plausibility papers
    - More papers to print and read tomorrow
V* rewrote my models pdf
V- wrote abstract for Rony and get back in contact

* do generalization tests on my models

* analysis of model weight values after training (Conv + Dense)

Future ideas:
*** check if the classifier can learn non conservative quantifiers
*** run this on random world/ general quantifier world/natural quantifier world to tease apart the effects of the world and that of the "computation cognitive bias".
