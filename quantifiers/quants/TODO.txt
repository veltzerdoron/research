* finish reading CNN papers and set meeting with Ezer.
* distinguish between classifiers according to monotonicity
* finish perusing quantifier booklets and set meeting with Roni.
* write weight analyzer in model class

Classfiers:
    * Finish the softmax AE classifier class
    * add testing evaluation results storage and exposure to user (add in tests)

*** Create quants python package and upload it to github / pypi as part of this research project

Done:

Classifiers:
* work on model class hierarchy
    * Finish running AE class and tests
    * generalize the AE and Classifier models

Quantifiers:
* improved quantifiers classes
    * multinomial distribution generation in fill and generation methods
    * multinomial selection of counts
    * quantifiers work according to constraints
    * natural and non natural quantifiers in hierarchy
* keep quantifier order
* min max scene len (add code option to generate limited lengths of scenes)

* handle out of memory issue when running the package twice
* write package tests for Quantifiers and Classifier
* code cleanup

* installed package locally and start working with it
