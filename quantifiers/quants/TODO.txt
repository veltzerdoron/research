*** Finish quants and upload it to pypi

* work on model class hierarchy
    * Finish the Dense AE classifier class and make its tests work

Future improvements:
    ** add testing evaluation results storage and exposure to user
    ** add tests that check accuracy of results



Done:

Bugs-
* The quantification entailment tests sometimes failed on "most" entails "some" edge cases,
  caught and fixed (edge case was that most was defined as ab >= a_b instead of >)

Classifiers-
* Fixed accuracies of multi-label classifier
* Wrote multi-label classifier class
* Thought about and ruled out weight analyzer in classifier class
* wrote code for teacher student
    leave repeat at 1 to neutralize

Quantifiers-
* added test for random scenes
* added test for contrastive quantifier learning and made it pass
* improved quantifier classes
    * multinomial distribution generation in fill and generation methods
    * multinomial selection of counts
    * quantifiers work according to constraints
    * natural and non natural quantifiers in hierarchy
    * unified all generate_scene methods under a single implementation with delegations
* quantifiers kept in order
* min max scene len (added code option to generate limited lengths of scenes for length generalization testing)

* handled out of memory issue when running the package twice

* write package tests for Quantifiers and Classifier
* code cleanup
* installed package locally and started working with it via notebook
