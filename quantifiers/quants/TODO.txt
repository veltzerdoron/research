* multinomial selection of counts
* quantifiers work according to constraints

* work on model class hierarchy
    * Finish running AE class and tests
    * generalize the AE and Classifier models
    * add testing evaluation results storage and exposure to user (add in tests)


* distinguish classifiers according to monotonicity
* multinomial distribution generation in fill and generation methods
* write weight analyzer in model class

*** Create quantifier python package and upload it to github / pypi as part of this research project

Done:
* handle out of memory issue when running the package twice
* write package tests for Quantifiers and Classifier
* keep quantifier order
* code cleanup
* min max scene len (add code option to generate limited lengths of scenes)
* classes
* install package locally and start working with it
